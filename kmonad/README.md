# KMonad Keyboard Layout

The KMonad tool offers customization and extensions for any keyboard.
This defines some extensions based on the Logitech Ergo K860 keyboard
with a international QWERTY layout. This is basically a US QUERTY layout
with some additional keys (e.g. the "102d" key).

## Setup

See:
https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/blob/master/doc/installation.md#windows-environment

## Startup

Use `logi_ergo_k860.bat` to startup the KMonad.exe in the background.

## Details

The folloging customizations are made:

### Caps-Lock as ESC/CTRL key

Caps-lock is remapped as ESC on tap and CTRL on hold.

### Menu Key

Due to a lack of the menu key (which comes handy if using keyboard in GUI applications),
the right CTRL key serves as a menu key on tap and CTRL on hold.

### Sticky Keys

Shift, Ctrl and Alt keys are sticky.

### Navigation Layer

Use `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` as arror keys (like in VIM).
Use `y`, `u`, `i`, `o` as `home`, `page-down`, `page-up`, `end` keys.

Activate via `f` key (tap-hold key feature).
Activate via `102d` key (the additional `\` key left of the `z` key.

### Numbers Layer

Use backtick/tilde to activate the layer.
